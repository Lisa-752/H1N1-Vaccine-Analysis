    "## Overview.\n",
    "Vaccine is a biological substance introduced into an individual that stimulates the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causeing the disease itself.\n",
    "* **Vaccination** is an effective tool that plays a crucial in public health by preventing the spread of a disease. However factors such as Individual behaviors, Opinions, Vaccination accessibility and coverage and Social-economic factors impact vaccination rates.\n",
    "* This study aims to analyze how Demographics, Opinions and Behaviors influence `H1N1 vaccination` uptake. Also this analysis owill enable us to estimate the likelihood of reaching herd immunity. By using a predictive model, I will be identifying high-risk individuals who are less likely to get vaccinated, this will allow public interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement.\n",
    "* Despite the availability of H1N1 vaccine, many individuals are unvaccinated due factors such Beliefs, Lack of Knowledge, Socio-economic factors, Age and History of Chronic Medical Condition. Understanding each factor can provide guidance for future Public Health efforts.\n",

    " * Develop a predictive model to determine whether individuals received the H1N1 vaccine.\n",

    " * Estimating Herd Immunity using Vaccination coverage and Risk-based factors.\n",
    "   - Examining vaccination coverage in different regions.\n",
    "   - Assessing Behaviour risk factors such as wearing masks, large gatherings and etc.\n",
    " * Understanding Behavariol, Attitudinal and Health factors Vaccination.\n",
    "   - Analyze how age, education, income, personal opinions or beliefs affect vaccination uptake.\n",
    "   - Here I will also identify reasons of `Vaccine efficacy`. \n",
    " * Evaluate the Role of Healthcare recommendation in vaccine decision.\n",
    "   - Assess the impact of a Healthcare Practitioners recommendation concerning vaccination uptake.\n",
    " * Identifying descrepancies in vaccine access and acceptance.\n",
    "   - Analyze aspects such as racial, geographic and socioeconomic disparity in vacination uptake. This will help identify       underserved communities.\n",
